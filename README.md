# Gitlet

Gitlet is a streamlined version control system inspired by Git, tailored to manage and track the evolution of projects with efficiency and simplicity.

## Core Functionalities
- **Committing**: Captures snapshots of directories, preserving the state of a project at points in time.
- **Checking Out**: Retrieves the state of files from previous commits, facilitating version control and rollback.
- **Logging**: Maintains a history of commits for review and tracking progress.
- **Branching**: Supports divergent paths of development, allowing experimentation and feature separation.
- **Merging**: Integrates changes across branches, reconciling different development trajectories.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Java Programming**: Entirely built using Java, showcasing object-oriented design and file I/O handling.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes trees and linked lists to manage commits and branching effectively.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Employs algorithms for efficient merging and conflict resolution.

This project is a testament to the application of computer science fundamentals in creating robust tools for developers to manage their codebase effectively.
